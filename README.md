# Groepswerk Front-end | Weather app

### JS Alchemists | Robbe Coninx - Niel Beynaerts

We are 2 students, currently studying Full-stack Webdevelopment at SyntraPXL, this project was made for a group project aimed at the Front-end part of our education.

### The project

In this project we created a weather app/website. With the use of a Weather API we get our real time weather data and display it on our website, made with only HTML/CSS and Javascript. 

#### Components

The app exist of 2 pages, on the first one you are asked some basic information wich we need to give you the wanted information.
We show you the weather forcast in the entered area, together with a little corresponding visual representation.
Next we show you, based on the birth date you entered on page 1, your Chinese horoscope, again with a visual representation and a quote about you!
